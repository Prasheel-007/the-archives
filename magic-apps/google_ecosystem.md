> "Google has a habit of silently releasing tools that feel like magic, then hiding them in plain sight. Here is the list of 'Secret' Google projects that normal users miss."

## 🧪 The "Labs" & AI Experiments
*Tools that are technically public but hidden from the main menu.*

### 1. [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
**The "Second Brain" for Students.**
Most people use ChatGPT, but NotebookLM is different. You upload your PDFs/Notes, and it becomes an expert *only* on that specific data.
* **My Use Case:** I feed it my entire semester's PDF notes and ask it to "Generate a quiz for tomorrow's exam."
* **Why it's magic:** It cites the exact page number where it found the answer. No hallucinations.

### 2. [Google Whisk (Saved)](https://www.google.com/save)
**The Recipe & Food AI.**
*Note: This project evolves often.* It allows you to save recipes from anywhere on the web and instantly turns them into a shopping list.
* **Why it matters:** It shows how Google creates "Collections" across the web.

### 3. [Project Gameface](https://github.com/google/project-gameface)
**Control PC with your Face.**
An open-source hands-free gaming mouse. It uses the webcam to track facial expressions and moves the cursor.
* **The Magic:** You can smile to click or raise eyebrows to drag.
* **Tech:** Built with MediaPipe.

## 🎨 Creative & Studio Tools

### 4. [Google FX / ImageFX](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/)
**The Midjourney Killer?**
Part of Google's "AI Test Kitchen." It generates high-quality images with text, but the interface is built for *creators*, not just prompters.
* **Feature:** "Expressive Chips" let you quickly swap styles without rewriting the prompt.

### 5. [MusicFX](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/music-fx)
**Text-to-Music.**
You type "Lo-fi beat for coding in a rainstorm," and it generates a seamless loop.
* **Status:** Experimental.

## ☁️ The "Invisible" Utility Layer

### 6. Google Cloud Skills Boost
Most students don't know they can get **free credits** to learn enterprise-level cloud computing here.
* **The Hack:** Completing specific "Quests" gives you badges that actually matter on LinkedIn (unlike random Udemy certs).

### 7. [Google Font & Icon Library](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
Everyone knows Google Fonts, but the **Icons** section is a hidden gem for developers.
* **Value:** Thousands of free, SVG-ready icons that fit the Material Design system perfectly.

## 🕹️ Easter Eggs & Legacy
